# AFFIDAVIT
## For Notarial Certification

### APPEARER

I, [FULL NAME], of legal age, with official identification [TYPE AND NUMBER], appear before the faith of the Notary Public number 230 of Mexico City, and under penalty of perjury:

### I DECLARE

**FIRST**: That I am responsible for the project called "Government Auditing System Mexico" and that I have developed an automated system for the download, validation, and certification of official audit formats from the Government of Mexico.

**SECOND**: That the documents contained in this notarial package were downloaded from the official website of the Government of Mexico, specifically from the Secretariat of Anti-Corruption and Good Government, at the following URL:

https://www.gob.mx/buengobierno/documentos/formatos-guias-e-instructivos-de-los-terminos-de-referencia-para-auditorias-de-los-estados-y-la-informacion-financiera-contable-y-presupues

**THIRD**: That immediately after the download of each document, its SHA-256 cryptographic hash was calculated, which was recorded in the digital chain of custody.

**FOURTH**: That all hashes were anchored on the Bitcoin blockchain through the OpenTimestamps protocol, providing an immutable and independently verifiable trusted timestamp.

**FIFTH**: That the system complies with all the requirements of the Official Mexican Standard NOM-151-SCFI-2016 for the conservation of data messages.

**SIXTH**: That the chain of custody records all events from the genesis hash (SHA-256 of an empty string) to the generation of this notarial package, without alterations.

**SEVENTH**: That all the information contained in this package is independently verifiable through:
- Calculation of SHA-256 hashes
- Verification of timestamps on the Bitcoin blockchain
- Review of the chain of custody

**EIGHTH**: That this package integrates with the North America Forensic Project, which contains evidence from 3,702 files from government sites in Mexico, the United States, and Canada.

**NINTH**: That the purpose of this system is to facilitate the audit of the Mexican State through Artificial Intelligence tools, with full legal validity before the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation.

**TENTH**: That I request the notarial certification of this package so that it has full legal validity in accordance with the Commerce Code, NOM-151-SCFI-2016, and the jurisprudence of the SCJN.

### OATH

I declare the foregoing under penalty of perjury, aware of the penalties incurred by those who conduct themselves with falsehood before an authority other than the judicial one.
